This is a game inspired by the masterpiece of Blagovest Penev's Signal Simulator.
The player solves complex tasks as a volunteer member of the ILA (Internet Liberation Association).
The game strives in no way for realism and is more focused on mathematics/logic implementation rather than the computer science/programming/developing sort, though an awful lot of elements are based on terms and concepts in real-world coding.
Python 3.12 is needed to run this. No plug-ins or external installations needed such as pygame.
